### Step 3. Now our data is ready to analyse. Let’s answer each business questions:

           Technology has most sales and profitable to the company.

   #### B. Most sold and profitable Sub-categories?
     
           Chairs, Storage and phones are most sold. Accessories, copiers and phones are most profitable to the company.

   #### C. Mode of shipping?
           
           About 60% used standard class shipping mode.

   #### D. Most common segment and which one was profitable?
   
           As we can see Consumer segment is most profitable, followed by Corporate.

   #### E. Region with most sales?
   
           70% of profits are coming from West and East regions. So the company should work on retaining those customers. 

   #### F. Orders by cities and the profitable one?
           New York I the city with most sales and most profitable to the company. Also, even though Philadelphia, Houston, Chicago and Jacksonville are
