 - Items with most orders: The data shows “Office Supplies” has most orders as per quantity. Technology has most sales and profitable to the company.

 - Most sold and profitable Sub-categories:  Chairs, Storage and phones are most sold. Accessories, copiers and phones are most profitable to the company.

 - Mode of shipping: About 60% used standard class shipping mode.

 - Most common segment and which one was profitable: As we can see Consumer segment is most profitable, followed by Corporate.

 - Region with most sales: 70% of profits are coming from West and East regions. So the company should work on retaining those customers.
