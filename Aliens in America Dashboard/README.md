# Aliens in America Dataset Challenge.
---------------------------------
***_I have participated in Ian's dataset challenge. The challenge is to create a dashboard or report and post it on LinkedIn_***
-------------------------------------------
## Get the data set [here](https://iklosowicz.gumroad.com/l/aliens-in-america)
-------------------------------------------------------
For this project I used PowerBI to create the report. 

It's the year 2022 and aliens are well known to be living amongst us.

Unfortunately, some of the aliens are a bit... too alien... and would like to fit into society a bit more.

So it's up to you to find the best state(s) we should market our new prescription.

It would be helpful to know...

    If these aliens are hostile
    Their diet
    Their age
