COVID Vaccination Process in Power BI

In this project we will explore COVID vaccine data and see how the vaccine process is going on in New Zealand.

Dataset - I have used Kaggle dataset found here - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress?select=country_vaccinations_by_manufacturer.csv

I used “country_vaccinations.csv” file for this case study.

The data (country vaccinations) contains the following information:
* Country- this is the country for which the vaccination information is provided;
* Country ISO Code - ISO code for the country;
* Date - date for the data entry; for some of the dates we have only the daily vaccinations, for others, only the (cumulative) total;
* Total number of vaccinations - this is the absolute number of total immunizations in the country;
* Total number of people vaccinated - a person, depending on the immunization scheme, will receive one or more (typically 2) vaccines; at a certain moment, the number of vaccination might be larger than the number of people;
* Total number of people fully vaccinated - this is the number of people that received the entire set of immunization according to the immunization scheme (typically 2); at a certain moment in time, there might be a certain number of people that received one vaccine and another number (smaller) of people that received all vaccines in the scheme;
* Daily vaccinations (raw) - for a certain data entry, the number of vaccination for that date/country;
* Daily vaccinations - for a certain data entry, the number of vaccination for that date/country;
* Total vaccinations per hundred - ratio (in percent) between vaccination number and total population up to the date in the country;
* Total number of people vaccinated per hundred - ratio (in percent) between population immunized and total population up to the date in the country;
* Total number of people fully vaccinated per hundred - ratio (in percent) between population fully immunized and total population up to the date in the country;
* Number of vaccinations per day - number of daily vaccination for that day and country;
* Daily vaccinations per million - ratio (in ppm) between vaccination number and total population for the current date in the country;
* Vaccines used in the country - total number of vaccines used in the country (up to date);
* Source name - source of the information (national authority, international organization, local organization etc.);
* Source website - website of the source of information;


Objective:

- Data import and cleaning
- Create data relationship
- Choose graphs for visualisation
- Publish in Power BI
